# neovim-windows-nightly

This project has a GitHub Actions workflow for building Neovim on Windows. The
code is scheduled to run each night.

This is a temporary workaround for the pause in official Neovim Windows nightly
builds starting at the end of November 2020.

The nightly Neovim package is available on the [Releases][releases] page.
