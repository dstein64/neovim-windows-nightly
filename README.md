# neovim-windows-nightly

This project has a GitHub Actions workflow that builds Neovim (x64) on Windows.
The code is scheduled to run nightly.

The nightly Neovim package is available on the [Releases][releases] page.

This is a temporary workaround for the pause in official Neovim Windows nightly
builds starting at the end of November 2020.
