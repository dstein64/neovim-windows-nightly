# neovim-windows-nightly

This project has a GitHub Actions workflow that builds Neovim (x64) on Windows.
The code was scheduled to run nightly, as a temporary workaround for the pause
in official Neovim Windows nightly builds that started at the end of November
2020.

As of Neovim [PR #13650](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/13650), official
Neovim Windows nightly builds have resumed, and are available on the  Neovim
[Releases](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases) page.
